   DFINITY was founded in 2016 by entrepreneur and crypto theoretician, Dominic Williams, and attracted interest and financial contributions from early members of the Ethereum community. Later, top-tier institutions such as Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, and SV Angel backed the Internet Computer in a collective effort to help build out Web3.   We are looking to expand our growing People Team at DFINITY with a representative for Asia.

  Create and maintain employee files, track annual trainings, review candidate documentation and manage background and credit checks 
  Proactively look for process improvements and automation to assist the People Ops team scale 
  Be willing to work with a small team on various company wide projects that will arise to help make DFINITY a premier destination for top talent

  <p>The Internet Computer is the fastest and only infinitely scalable general-purpose blockchain — incubated and launched by the DFINITY Foundation in May 2021. A team of over 200 world-renowned cryptographers, distributed systems engineers, and programming language experts have taken on the massive technological challenge of building, maintaining, and continuously improving a 'world computer' powerful enough to host Web3 dApps, DeFi, games, NFTs, social media, and metaverse projects.</p> 
  <p> DFINITY was founded in 2016 by entrepreneur and crypto theoretician, Dominic Williams, and attracted interest and financial contributions from early members of the Ethereum community. Later, top-tier institutions such as Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, and SV Angel backed the Internet Computer in a collective effort to help build out Web3.</p>
 </div>
 <p> We are looking to expand our growing People Team at DFINITY with a representative for Asia.

We are looking for someone interested in being part of the leading project building Web 3.0.</p> 
 <p> For this role we are looking to add an HR and Recruiting Generalist, focused on HR Ops & Recruiting to support our new site in Shanghai. With our rapid expansion plans in the region, we expect this role to have tremendous growth opportunities.</p> 
 <p> You'll be working on our internal HR systems and working closely with Senior Leadership and a growing People team to ensure incoming and existing employees' experiences seamless as they onboard, transfer teams, or relocate.

  <li>Create and maintain employee files, track annual trainings, review candidate documentation and manage background and credit checks</li> 
  <li>Proactively look for process improvements and automation to assist the People Ops team scale</li> 
  <li>Be willing to work with a small team on various company wide projects that will arise to help make DFINITY a premier destination for top talent</li>
